# hello-tapestry
Tapestry 5 is framework for creating web applications using Java. The framework allows you to generate HTML pages using Java code. This a good thing if you have complex business logic that takes data from the user, database, online resources to present a result as a webpage. We wanted to do something like that for one of our econometric models so we decided to give Tapestry a go for building our web application. Along the way we learned quite a lot about the framework. Some of that we want to share here in a series of blogs. The complete series should be enough to build simple GUI for your Java business logic.
